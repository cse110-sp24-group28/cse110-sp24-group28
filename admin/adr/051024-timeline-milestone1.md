# Timeline of User Stories for Milestone 1

## Status
Implemented and Approved

## Context
The team needed to establish the sequence for completing the User Stories to ensure a logical progression in the development process.

## Decision
The following order has been decided for completing the User Stories:
- User Story 1  due 5/15
- User Story 2  due 5/19
- User Story 3  due 5/23

## Rationale
The chosen order of User Stories reflects a prioritization based on dependencies. Starting with User Story 1 allows the team to focus on foundational features before moving on to more functionalities in User Story 2 and User Story 3.

## Consequences
- Clear direction for development activities, ensuring a systematic approach to feature implementation
- Risk of overlooking dependencies or complexities that may arise during implementation, leading to rework or adjustments in the plan
- Linear timeline can make it harder to adjust issues fron previous work

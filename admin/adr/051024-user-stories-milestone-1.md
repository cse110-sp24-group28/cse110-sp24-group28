# Selection of User Stories for Each Sub-Group for Milestone 1

## Status
Implemented and Approved

## Context
The team needs to allocate specific User Stories to each sub-group to ensure efficient progress.

## Decision
Each sub-group will choose one of the following User Stories:
- User Story 1: US1-1 Day 
- User Story 2: US2-1 Create Journal and US2-2 Create Task
- User Story 3: US3-1 See Task list

## Rationale
Assigning distinct User Stories to each sub-group allows for focused attention on specific functionalities, ensuring thorough implementation and timely completion. 

## Consequences

# Setup JSDoc

## Status
Approved

## Context
As the project grows in complexity and the development team expands, there is an increasing need for consistent and accessible documentation. This will assist both current and future developers in understanding, maintaining, and extending the codebase effectively.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt JSDoc as the standard tool for documenting the JavaScript codebase. This involves annotating the source code with JSDoc comments to ensure thorough documentation of functions, classes, parameters, and returns.

## Rationale
JSDoc was chosen because it is widely recognized and supported within the JavaScript community. It integrates well with most IDEs and editors, providing real-time documentation and type checking support. JSDoc also allows for generating HTML documentation websites automatically from the source code, which makes it easier to share documentation with both internal and external stakeholders.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Improved code quality and consistency across the project.
- Easier onboarding and reduced learning curve for new developers.
- Enhanced ability to maintain and debug code with up-to-date and accessible documentation.

**Negative:**
- Initial time investment required to document existing code and train developers on effective JSDoc usage.
- Possible slowdown in development velocity in the short term as developers adapt to the new documentation requirements.

## More Details

The decision was made in a recent team meeting after reviewing several documentation tools and gathering input from all team members, including lead developers and project managers.

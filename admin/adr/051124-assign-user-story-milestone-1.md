# Assign User Stories to Sub-Groups for Milestone 1

## Status
Implemented and Approved

## Context
The team needed to allocate specific User Stories to each sub-group, considering their deadlines and dependencies.

## Decision
The following assignments have been made:
- User Story 1 & Database: Group 1, due 5/15
- User Story 2: Group 2, due 5/19
- User Story 3: Group 3, due 5/23

## Rationale
Assigning User Stories to groups based on deadlines ensures efficient time management and allows each group to focus on completing their assigned tasks within the specified timeframe.

## Consequences
- Clear division of responsibilities for each sub-group
- Improved efficiency in development and testing processes 
- Timely completion of tasks, meeting project milestones and deadlines
- Risk of bottlenecks or delays if dependencies between groups are not managed effectively
- Can reduce communication between subteams if only focusing on their respective task

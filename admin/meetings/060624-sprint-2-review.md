Varun: Worked on user story 4 with Chenyu, Nicole, Celeste, and Anirvinna. Created the documentation for all the CSS styling done on it. Fixed a bug that changed the positioning of the task and journal buttons when opening the task and journal pages respectively. Wrote the documentation for all the Javascript functions to be able to be viewed via JSDocs and documented all of the test files.

Nicole: Worked on user story 4 with Varun, Chenyu, Celeste, and Anirvinna. Improved the UI by making the title text input box and entry/details input box of equal length for both the journal and task portions.

Chenyu: Worked on user story 4 with Varun, Celeste, Nicole, and Anirvinna. Adjusted the journal and task window by centering them, having x changed to be the exit button with a red color, and highlighting the active button when either journal or task is clicked, added a hover effect for the main window for a few buttons, added space between viewing tasks and journals, and some tiny details to make the whole UI more balanced.

Ayah: Worked on user story 6 with Sara, Yuvanand, and Anirvinna, and worked on adding the mood tracker emojis. Added the emojis in the HTML file, then designed them and styled them in CSS, and then added their functionality where only the emoji chosen gets highlighted and the rest do not, as well as they only appear in the journal and not in the tasks view.
